# Why?
I'm a seasoned developer getting my hands less dirty due to managerial and other team related ceramonies nowadays.  
In the meantime, I wanted to keep my skills sharp to be in the loop not to loose fun of programming.  
For this reason, I subscribed to [dailycodingproblem.com](dailycodingproblem.com) to get some tricky questions.

# When?
I solve these questions whenever I find time. I try to solve them applying TDD under an hour.  
Hopefully, I can keep this up!

# What?
My initial solution to the problem. I might be missing edge cases or my code would be not really optimised.  
However, in a world of MVPs and race to the market with half-baked products, who cares?  

# Programming is fun!
I always believed and will keep believing!
